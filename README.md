# Ziffer

## A small android app to help you learn to recognize German numbers.

In German, numbers from 20 to 99 have a different naming structure than in English and other languages.
42 for example is "fourty-two" in English and "zweiundvierzig" in German, so "two-and-fourty".


This leads to confusion for non-native speakers, especially in situations when it is important to quickly recognize spoken numbers:
* Which platform your train arrives at
* At what time do you have an appointment
* And so on


The **Ziffer** app helps train listening and quickly recognizing the German numbers.
Onc eyou open the app, tap **Start** and it will launch the game. 
You have a limited time to listen and type in as many numbers as you can. 


In thes setting you can change how long one game is, how fast the numbers are read and the delay between your answer and the next number.

## Requirements

* Android 5.0+
